## Data Security Commitment

Nebula Api takes user data security seriously with multiple protection measures. We're committed to providing secure, reliable AI services.

## Core Security Measures

### End-to-End Encryption

<Card title="TLS 1.3 Encryption" icon="lock">
  All data transmission uses **TLS 1.3 protocol encryption**:
  - Latest encryption standard for strongest protection
  - Prevents data interception or tampering
  - End-to-end encryption from user to server
</Card>

### Minimal Data Storage

**Relay Platform Advantage**

As a relay platform, Nebula Api:
- **Doesn't store request content**: No saving of API request inputs/outputs
- **Can't view user data**: Technical team cannot access conversation content
- **Immediate deletion**: Content cleared after processing
- **Privacy first**: Maximum user privacy protection

<Note>
As a relay platform, our job is to forward requests securely and efficiently, not store user data. This design fundamentally protects your privacy.
</Note>

### Limited Logging

**Basic Log Scope**

We only log essential information for billing and troubleshooting:
- **Model name**: For billing and statistics
- **Token counts**: Input and output token counts
- **Timestamps**: For log analysis and debugging
- **Response status**: Success or error states

**What we DON'T log**
- ❌ Conversation content
- ❌ User input text
- ❌ AI output responses
- ❌ Images or file content
- ❌ Personal identity information

### Short-term Log Retention

<Card title="Log Retention Period" icon="clock">
  **Retention: Only 7 days**
  
  Reasons:
  - **Data security**: Reduce data breach risk
  - **Resource optimization**: Minimize storage costs
  - **Privacy protection**: Minimal data retention
  - **Compliance**: Meet data protection regulations
  
  After 7 days, all logs are automatically deleted and cannot be recovered.

## Access Control

### Strict Permission Management

**Authorized Access Only**
- **Least privilege**: Only authorized personnel can access logs
